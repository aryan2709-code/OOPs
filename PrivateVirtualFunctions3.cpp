// What's happening in this program , the virtual method is private in both the base as well as the derived class , but we have a public method in the base 
//class that indirectly calls the private virtual method
//d.show() is public â†’ it internally calls printMe(), and polymorphism ensures Derived::printMe() is called if the object is of Derived.

// This is a classic NON VIRTUAL INTERFACE pattern : define a public non virtual function in base that calls a private virtual function.

// Access control is compile time , but dispatch is runtime as long as you are allowed to call the base class version , the correct derived version will 
//run even if it is private
